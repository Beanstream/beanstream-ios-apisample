/**
 * The demo apps purpose is to serve as an example of how to use the Beanstream SDK for iOS. Here we have
 * a simple 'e-commerce' style app that facilitates the sale of any number of golden eggs the only
 * available product. A user indicates the number of golden eggs to be purchased at a price of $USD 1.00
 * and a running total that is converted to the devices locale specific country currency is displayed along
 * with a fictitious sales tax of 5%.
 *
 * To be able to compile this project you can clone the git source repo to a working directory. As dependencies
 * you will also need to clone the Beanstream API Simulator repo and then ensure all other dependencies are
 * installed via CocoaPods.
 *
 * This demo app has dependencies (check the Podfile) on public 3rd party libraries that include ReactiveCocoa,
 * Money and MBProgressHUD. There is also a dependency on the non-public Beanstream SDK. These
 * dependencies are installed via CocoaPods.
 *
 * Note that the Beanstream SDK itself has CocoaPods specified dependencies that include AFNetworking v2.6.0.
